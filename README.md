This project came from a Udemy course by Angela Yu, The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp.

I modified it the following way:

1. Replaced Bootstrap with regular CSS
2. Used flexbox widely
3. Slightly changed structure, wording(mostly reduced words in pricing section), and background animation
4. Added javascript for button background animation in pricing section
